TODO

1) fix visualization to only appear if visualization flag is set to true
2) add turns until resource available to redundant state detection maybe? if two states are waiting for a resource with the same state but one state has a different amount of turns left until it becomes avaialble (akeed htb2a more 3ashan dee new state), is it redundant in this case?
